# Slide decks from the 2016 conference

This repository contains the slide decks from the
[PromCon talks in 2016](http://promcon.io/2016-berlin/schedule/) in the form of
“old style” files. Slide decks on slide sharing platforms (like Slideshare or
in the form of Google slides) might go away if accounts get deleted and
such. In that case, you can still see the slides here.

The following table contains links to the slides in their original form.
